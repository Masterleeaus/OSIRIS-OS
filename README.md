## What is AIPlatform?
AIPlatform unifies:
- a multi-tenant AI SaaS dashboard and landing site,
- a Gen-AI engine (`gen-ai-engine`),
- quantum engineering experimental modules (`quantum-engineering/core`),
- git integrations and bridges (`gitflic`, `git-systems`),
- adapters for platforms and storage.

It’s intended as a starting product for AI-driven SaaS with production-ready Docker, CI, and modular architecture.

---

## Features
- Multi-dimensional GenAI engine (prompts, fine-tuning, pipelines)
- Quantum-aware modules for experimental accelerations
- Multi-deployment: Docker Compose, multi-platform Dockerfile, Kubernetes-ready scaffolding
- Ready integrations: GitHub/GitLab/webhooks, storage adapters, realtime clients
- Developer tooling: tests, linting, release scripts
