# Multi-Platform AIPlatform Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project Structure Overhaul
- [ ] Create platforms/ directory structure
- [ ] Create builds/ directory for build configurations
- [ ] Create bridges/ for cross-platform communication
- [ ] Create verticals/ and horizontals/ for architecture scaling
- [ ] Reorganize docs/ with platform-specific subdirectories

## Phase 2: Build System Enhancement
- [ ] Update package.json with platform-specific build scripts
- [ ] Add Electron configuration for desktop platforms
- [ ] Add React Native/Capacitor for mobile platforms
- [ ] Configure WinUWP builds
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline configurations

## Phase 3: Platform-Specific Implementations
- [ ] iOS platform setup and configuration
- [ ] macOS platform setup and configuration
- [ ] Windows platform setup and configuration
- [ ] Linux platform setup and configuration
- [ ] Web platform optimization
- [ ] WinUWP platform setup
- [ ] Aurora platform setup

## Phase 4: Architecture Scaling
- [ ] Implement bridge patterns for platform interoperability
- [ ] Create vertical slices for domain-specific features
- [ ] Add horizontal layers for shared services
- [ ] Modularize extensions for platform portability

## Phase 5: Documentation and Version Control
- [ ] Create platform-specific documentation
- [ ] Set up GitHub/GitLab configurations
- [ ] Add domestic systems support (GitFlic, SourceCraft, GitVerse)
- [ ] Add international systems support (Canadian, Israeli, Arabic, Australian, Chinese, etc.)
- [ ] Organize all documents and notes by platform

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Install cross-platform development tools
- [ ] Test builds on each platform
- [ ] Update CI/CD configurations
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for each platform
